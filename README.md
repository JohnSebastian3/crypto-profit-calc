# Welcome to How Much Would I Have?
This site lets you input how much you invested in a certain coin at a specific date. Then, it shows you how much you would have today. Currently, it only supports USD.
I built this using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. For the market information, I used Coin Gecko's Crypto API, which can be found here: https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation
